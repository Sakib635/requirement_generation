# Requirements Generation and Versioning Automation
This project automates the generation of a requirements.txt file for your project using pipreqs and ensures package versions are aligned with the project's creation and last update dates. Follow the steps below to set up and execute the process.

## Setup Instructions
Configure Paths and Dates
Open pipreqs.py and update the project_path variable to match your project directory:

`project_path = "C:/Users/sakib51/Documents/requirement_generation/exampleProject"`

Open newReqFile.py and update:

Project creation date:

`repo_creation_date = datetime.strptime("2015-06-20", "%Y-%m-%d")`

Last update date:

`last_update_date = datetime.strptime("2021-04-12", "%Y-%m-%d")`

Path to the generated requirements.txt:

`requirements_path = "C:/Users/sakib51/Documents/requirement_generation/exampleProject/requirements.txt"`
Path for the new requirements.txt file:

`new_requirements_path = "C:/Users/sakib51/Documents/requirement_generation/exampleProject/new_requirements.txt"`

## Execution Steps
Generate Initial requirements.txt Run the following command to create a requirements.txt file listing all the packages used in your project:

python pipreqs.py

Set Package Versions Run the following command to create a new requirements.txt file with package versions determined by the project's creation and last update dates:

`python newReqFile.py`

Output:

The updated requirements.txt with proper versioning will be saved at:

`C:/Users/sakib51/Documents/requirement_generation/exampleProject/new_requirements.txt`

## How It Works
pipreqs.py

Scans your project directory to identify the imported packages and creates a requirements.txt file with the package names.

newReqFile.py

Reads the requirements.txt file generated by pipreqs.py.
Uses the provided creation and last update dates to determine compatible package versions.
Saves the updated requirements.txt to a new file.

Project Structure

`requirement_generation/`
``├── pipreqs.py             # Script to generate `requirements.txt` ``

`├── newReqFile.py          # Script to set package versions based on project dates`

`├── exampleProject/        # Example project directory`

`│   ├── your_project_files # Files for your project`

``│   ├── requirements.txt   # File generated by `pipreqs.py` ``

`│   ├── new_requirements.txt # Final requirements file with versioning`

## Example Use Case
If your project was created on June 20, 2015, and last updated on April 12, 2021:

The generated requirements.txt file will specify versions compatible with these dates, ensuring reproducibility and stability in package dependencies.
